Tic-tac-toe is a simple and fun game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project is a web application that allows you to play tic-tac-toe online using React JS, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
